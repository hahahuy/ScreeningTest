#Screening Test: Your Project Name Here
This repository contains the code for a screening test project.

#What is the Screening Test?

ðŸ’¡ Develop a Python program to generate a list of 2n unique random positive integers, each using a maximum of n bits and represented in decimals, and another random positive integer, k, using n bits.  Then, choose one (or more, if you prefer) of the following options to implement:

Check if k exists in the list.

+ Find all integers less than k in the list.

+ Display the results and the number of steps required to achieve them.
